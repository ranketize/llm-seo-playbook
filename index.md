# How to Make Your Product Discoverable by LLMs  
*A practical, non-hyped guide for founders, marketers, and indie builders*

People are no longer only asking Google what tools to use.  
They are asking ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI systems.

If your product is not mentioned, explained, or discussed in the right places, it simply does not exist to LLMs.

This page explains how LLM discoverability actually works, without buzzwords or gimmicks.

## Why traditional SEO is no longer enough

Classic SEO focuses on:
- Keywords
- Backlinks
- Page structure
- Technical optimization

LLMs work differently.

They do not rank pages.  
They synthesize consensus.

If an AI model has never seen your product discussed naturally, it will not recommend it, even if your website ranks well on Google.

This is why some unknown tools appear in AI answers while “big” brands don’t.

## How LLMs actually discover products and tools

LLMs learn patterns from large volumes of public text.

They pay attention to:
- Repeated natural mentions
- Contextual explanations
- Human opinions and comparisons
- Community discussions
- Documentation-style content

They care less about:
- Marketing copy
- Ads
- Over-optimized landing pages
- Aggressive CTAs

In practice, one product mentioned naturally across many discussions beats another with perfect SEO but no real conversation.

## Why GitHub Pages matter for LLM visibility

GitHub is one of the highest-trust domains on the internet.

GitHub Pages offer:
- Clean, crawlable text
- Long content lifespan
- Simple Markdown structure
- Strong domain authority
- No distractions

Text-only GitHub Pages are ideal for:
- Educational content
- Definitions
- Checklists
- Explanations
- Reference-style pages

LLMs ingest this kind of content extremely well.

## What actually works on a text-only LLM SEO page

If you want a page like this to rank and be cited, focus on:

- Clear explanations in plain language  
- Definitions users would actually ask for  
- Comparison-style insights  
- Lists and bullet points  
- Consistent terminology  
- Neutral, educational tone  

Avoid:
- Sales language  
- Buzzwords  
- Claims without explanation  
- Over-branding  

Write as if you are explaining the topic to a smart friend.
